abstract = {In a spin glass with Ising spins, the problems of computing the magnetic partition function and finding a ground state are studied. In a finite two-dimensional lattice these problems can be solved by algorithms that require a number of steps bounded by a polynomial function of the size of the lattice. In contrast to this fact, the same problems are shown to belong to the class of w-hard problems, both in the two-dimensional case within a magnetic field, and in the three-dimensional case. Np-hardness of a problem suggests that it is very unlikely that a polynomial algorithm could exist to solve it.},

abstract = {Differentiable programming is a fresh programming paradigm which composes parameterized algorithmic components and optimizes them using gradient search. The concept emerges from deep learning but is not limited to training neural networks. We present the theory and practice of programming tensor network algorithms in a fully differentiable way. By formulating the tensor network algorithm as a computation graph, one can compute higher-order derivatives of the program accurately and efficiently using automatic differentiation. We present essential techniques to differentiate through the tensor networks contraction algorithms, including numerical stable differentiation for tensor decompositions and efficient backpropagation through fixed-point iterations. As a demonstration, we compute the specific heat of the Ising model directly by taking the second-order derivative of the free energy obtained in the tensor renormalization group calculation. Next, we perform gradient-based variational optimization of infinite projected entangled pair states for the quantum antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and obtain state-of-the-art variational energy and magnetization with moderate efforts. Differentiable programming removes laborious human efforts in deriving and implementing analytical gradients for tensor network programs, which opens the door to more innovations in tensor network algorithms and applications.},

abstract = {Near term quantum computers with a high quantity (around 50) and quality (around 0.995 fidelity for two-qubit gates) of qubits will approximately sample from certain probability distributions beyond the capabilities of known classical algorithms on state-of-the-art computers, achieving the first milestone of so-called quantum supremacy. This has stimulated recent progress in classical algorithms to simulate quantum circuits. Classical simulations are also necessary to approximate the fidelity of multiqubit quantum computers using cross entropy benchmarking. Here we present numerical results of a classical simulation algorithm to sample universal random circuits, on a single workstation, with more qubits and depth than previously reported. For example, circuits with {\$}5 \backslashtimes 9{\$} qubits of depth 37, {\$}7 \backslashtimes 8{\$} qubits of depth 27, and {\$}10 \backslashtimes (\backslashkappa {\textgreater} 10){\$}) qubits of depth 19 are all easy to sample. We also show up to what depth the sampling, or estimation of observables, is trivially parallelizable. The algorithm is related to the "Feynmann path" method to simulate quantum circuits. For low-depth circuits, the algorithm scales exponentially in the depth times the smaller lateral dimension, or the treewidth, as explained in Boixo et. al., and therefore confirms the bounds in that paper. In particular, circuits with {\$}7 \backslashtimes 7{\$} qubits and depth 40 remain currently out of reach. Follow up work on a supercomputer environment will tighten this bound.},

abstract = {We present ForwardDiff, a Julia package for forward-mode automatic differentiation (AD) featuring performance competitive with low-level languages like C++. Unlike recently developed AD tools in other popular high-level languages such as Python and MATLAB, ForwardDiff takes advantage of just-in-time (JIT) compilation to transparently recompile AD-unaware user code, enabling efficient support for higher-order differentiation and differentiation using custom number types (including complex numbers). For gradient and Jacobian calculations, ForwardDiff provides a variant of vector-forward mode that avoids expensive heap allocation and makes better use of memory bandwidth than traditional vector mode. In our numerical experiments, we demonstrate that for nontrivially large dimensions, ForwardDiff's gradient computations can be faster than a reverse-mode implementation from the Python-based autograd package. We also illustrate how ForwardDiff is used effectively within JuMP, a modeling language for optimization. According to our usage statistics, 41 unique repositories on GitHub depend on ForwardDiff, with users from diverse fields such as astronomy, optimization, finite element analysis, and statistics.

Moreover, functional tensors are a natural candidate for generalized variable elimination and parallel-scan filtering algorithms that enable parallel exact inference for a large family of tractable modeling motifs. We demonstrate the versatility of functional tensors by integrating them into the modeling frontend and inference backend of the Pyro programming language.

These tensor networks are interpreted by diagrams of the ZH-calculus: a system to reason about tensors over {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}C{\}}{\$} in terms of diagrams built from simple generators, in which computation may be carried out by $\backslash$emph{\{}transformations of diagrams alone{\}}. In general, nodes of ZH diagrams take parameters over {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}C{\}}{\$} which determine the tensor coefficients; for the standard representation of $\backslash${\#}SAT instances, the coefficients take the value {\$}0{\$} or {\$}1{\$}. Then, by choosing the coefficients of a diagram to range over {\$}\backslashmathbb B{\$}, we represent the corresponding instance of SAT. Thus, by interpreting a diagram either over the boolean semiring or the complex numbers, we instantiate either the $\backslash$emph{\{}decision{\}} or $\backslash$emph{\{}counting{\}} version of the problem. We find that for classes known to be in P, such as {\$}2{\$}SAT and $\backslash${\#}XORSAT, the existence of appropriate rewrite rules allows for efficient simplification of the diagram, producing the solution in polynomial time. In contrast, for classes known to be NP-complete, such as {\$}3{\$}SAT, or $\backslash${\#}P-complete, such as $\backslash${\#}{\$}2{\$}SAT, the corresponding rewrite rules introduce hyperedges to the diagrams, in numbers which are not easily bounded above by a polynomial.

@article{Fried2018,
abstract = {Classical simulation of quantum computation is necessary for studying the numerical behavior of quantum algorithms, as there does not yet exist a large viable quantum computer on which to perform numerical tests. Tensor network (TN) contraction is an algorithmic method that can efficiently simulate some quantum circuits, often greatly reducing the computational cost over methods that simulate the full Hilbert space. In this study we implement a tensor network contraction program for simulating quantum circuits using multi-core compute nodes. We show simulation results for the Max-Cut problem on 3-through 7-regular graphs using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), successfully simulating up to 100 qubits. We test two different methods for generating the ordering of tensor index contractions: one is based on the tree decomposition of the line graph, while the other generates ordering using a straight-forward stochastic scheme. Through studying instances of QAOA circuits, we show the expected result that as the treewidth of the quantum circuit's line graph decreases, TN contraction becomes significantly more efficient than simulating the whole Hilbert space. The results in this work suggest that tensor contraction methods are superior only when simulating Max-Cut/QAOA with graphs of regularities approximately five and below. Insight into this point of equal computational cost helps one determine which simulation method will be more efficient for a given quantum circuit. The stochastic contraction method outperforms the line graph based method only when the time to calculate a reasonable tree decomposition is prohibitively expensive. Finally, we release our software package, qTorch (Quantum TensOR Contraction Handler), intended for general quantum circuit simulation. For a nontrivial subset of these quantum circuits, 50 to 100 qubits can easily be simulated on a single compute node.},

In machine learning, generative models represent another large class which is widely used for both supervised and unsupervised learning. Here, we propose an efficient quantum algorithm for machine learning based on a quantum generative model. We prove that our proposed model is exponentially more powerful to represent probability distributions compared with classical generative models and has exponential speedup in training and inference at least for some instances under a reasonable assumption in computational complexity theory.

We introduce Torch-Struct, a library for structured prediction designed to take advantage of and integrate with vectorized, auto-differentiation based frameworks. Torch-Struct includes a broad collection of probabilistic structures accessed through a simple and flexible distribution-based API that connects to any deep learning model. The library utilizes batched, vectorized operations and exploits auto-differentiation to produce readable, fast, and testable code.

@article{Huang2020b,
abstract = {It is believed that random quantum circuits are difficult to simulate classically. These have been used to demonstrate quantum supremacy: the execution of a computational task on a quantum computer that is infeasible for any classical computer. The task underlying the assertion of quantum supremacy by Arute et al. (Nature, 574, 505--510 (2019)) was initially estimated to require Summit, the world's most powerful supercomputer today, approximately 10,000 years. The same task was performed on the Sycamore quantum processor in only 200 seconds. In this work, we present a tensor network-based classical simulation algorithm. Using a Summit-comparable cluster, we estimate that our simulator can perform this task in less than 20 days. On moderately-sized instances, we reduce the runtime from years to minutes, running several times faster than Sycamore itself. These estimates are based on explicit simulations of parallel subtasks, and leave no room for hidden costs. The simulator's key ingredient is identifying and optimizing the "stem" of the computation: a sequence of pairwise tensor contractions that dominates the computational cost. This orders-of-magnitude reduction in classical simulation time, together with proposals for further significant improvements, indicates that achieving quantum supremacy may require a period of continuing quantum hardware developments without an unequivocal first demonstration.},

abstract = {Tensor networks represent the state-of-the-art in computational methods across many disciplines, including the classical simulation of quantum many-body systems and quantum circuits. Several applications of current interest give rise to tensor networks with irregular geometries. Finding the best possible contraction path for such networks is a central problem, with an exponential effect on computation time and memory footprint. In this work, we implement new randomized protocols that find very high quality contraction paths for arbitrary and large tensor networks. We test our methods on a variety of benchmarks, including the random quantum circuit instances recently implemented on Google quantum chips. We find that the paths obtained can be very close to optimal, and often many orders or magnitude better than the most established approaches. As different underlying geometries suit different methods, we also introduce a hyper-optimization approach, where both the method applied and its algorithmic parameters are tuned during the path finding. The increase in quality of contraction schemes found has significant practical implications for the simulation of quantum many-body systems and particularly for the benchmarking of new quantum chips.},

Our model enjoys efficient learning analogous to the density matrix renormalization group method, which allows dynamically adjusting dimensions of the tensors and offers an efficient direct sampling approach for generative tasks. We apply our method to generative modeling of several standard data sets including the Bars and Stripes random binary patterns and the MNIST handwritten digits to illustrate the abilities, features, and drawbacks of our model over popular generative models such as the Hopfield model, Boltzmann machines, and generative adversarial networks.

abstract = {Many interesting but practically intractable problems can be reduced to that of finding the ground state of a system of interacting spins; however, finding such a ground state remains computationally difficult. It is believed that the ground state of some naturally occurring spin systems can be effectively attained through a process called quantum annealing. If it could be harnessed, quantum annealing might improve on known methods for solving certain types of problem. However, physical investigation of quantum annealing has been largely confined to microscopic spins in condensed-matter systems. Here we use quantum annealing to find the ground state of an artificial Ising spin system comprising an array of eight superconducting flux quantum bits with programmable spin-spin couplings. We observe a clear signature of quantum annealing, distinguishable from classical thermal annealing through the temperature dependence of the time at which the system dynamics freezes. Our implementation can be configured in situ to realize a wide variety of different spin networks, each of which can be monitored as it moves towards a low-energy configuration. This programmable artificial spin network bridges the gap between the theoretical study of ideal isolated spin networks and the experimental investigation of bulk magnetic samples. Moreover, with an increased number of spins, such a system may provide a practical physical means to implement a quantum algorithm, possibly allowing more-effective approaches to solving certain classes of hard combinatorial optimization problems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Tensor networks are powerful factorization techniques which reduce resource requirements for numerically simulating principal quantum many-body systems and algorithms. The computational complexity of a tensor network simulation depends on the tensor ranks and the order in which they are contracted. Unfortunately, computing optimal contraction sequences (orderings) in general is known to be a computationally difficult (NP-complete) task. In 2005, Markov and Shi showed that optimal contraction sequences correspond to optimal (minimum width) tree decompositions of a tensor network's line graph, relating the contraction sequence problem to a rich literature in structural graph theory. While treewidth-based methods have largely been ignored in favor of dataset-specific algorithms in the prior tensor networks literature, we demonstrate their practical relevance for problems arising from two distinct methods used in quantum simulation: multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) datasets and quantum circuits generated by the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). We exhibit multiple regimes where treewidth-based algorithms outperform domain-specific algorithms, while demonstrating that the optimal choice of algorithm has a complex dependence on the network density, expected contraction complexity, and user run time requirements. We further provide an open source software framework designed with an emphasis on accessibility and extendability, enabling replicable experimental evaluations and future exploration of competing methods by practitioners.},

Motivated by present-day quantum annealers, we mainly focus on hard structured problems on the chimera graph with up to {\$}2048{\$} spins. To this end, we apply a branch and bound strategy over marginal probability distributions by approximately evaluating tensor contractions. Our approach identifies configurations with the largest Boltzmann weights corresponding to low energy states. Moreover, by exploiting local nature of the problems, we discover spin-glass droplets geometries. This naturally encompasses sampling from high quality solutions within a given approximation ratio. It is thus established that tensor networks techniques can provide profound insight into the structure of disordered spin complexes, with ramifications both for machine learning and noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. At the same time, limitations of our approach highlight alternative directions to establish quantum speed-up and possible quantum supremacy experiments.},

These simulations were carried out using qFlex, a tensor-network-based classical high-performance simulator of RQCs. Our results show an advantage of many orders of magnitude in energy consumption of NISQ devices over classical supercomputers. In addition, we propose a standard benchmark for NISQ computers based on qFlex.},

@article{Dudek2019,
abstract = {Constrained counting is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence. A promising new algebraic approach to constrained counting makes use of tensor networks, following a reduction from constrained counting to the problem of tensor-network contraction. Contracting a tensor network efficiently requires determining an efficient order to contract the tensors inside the network, which is itself a difficult problem. In this work, we apply graph decompositions to find contraction orders for tensor networks. We prove that finding an efficient contraction order for a tensor network is equivalent to the well-known problem of finding an optimal carving decomposition. Thus memory-optimal contraction orders for planar tensor networks can be found in cubic time. We show that tree decompositions can be used both to find carving decompositions and to factor tensor networks with high-rank, structured tensors. We implement these algorithms on top of state-of-the-art solvers for tree decompositions and show empirically that the resulting weighted model counter is quite effective and useful as part of a portfolio of counters.},

The GDL is a synthesis of the work of many authors in the information theory, digital communications, signal processing, statistics, and artificial intelligence communities. It includes as special cases the Baum-Welch algorithm, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) on any finite Abelian group, the Gallager-Tanner-Wiberg decoding algorithm, Viterbi's algorithm, the BCJR algorithm, Pearl's "belief propagation" algorithm, the Shafer-Shenoy probability propagation algorithm, and the turbo decoding algorithm. Although this algorithm is guaranteed to give exact answers only in certain cases (the "junction tree" condition), unfortunately not including the cases of GTW with cycles or turbo decoding, there is much experimental evidence, and a few theorems, suggesting that it often works approximately even when it is not supposed to. {\textcopyright} 2000 IEEE.},

abstract = {We demonstrate how to compute the low energy spectrum for small ({\$}N\backslashle 50{\$}), but otherwise arbitrary, spin-glass instances using modern Graphics Processing Units or similar heterogeneous architecture. Our algorithm performs an exhaustive (i.e., brute-force) search of all possible configurations to select {\$}S\backslashll 2{\^{}}N{\$} lowest ones together with their corresponding energies. We mainly focus on the Ising model defined on an arbitrary graph. An open-source implementation based on CUDA Fortran and a suitable Python wrapper are provided. As opposed to heuristic approaches, ours is exact and thus can serve as a references point to benchmark other algorithms and hardware, including quantum and digital annealers. Our implementation offers unprecedented speed and efficiency already visible on commodity hardware. At the same time, it can be easily launched on professional, high-end graphics cards virtually at no extra effort. As a practical application, we employ it to demonstrate that the recent Matrix Product State based algorithm-despite its one-dimensional nature-can still accurately approximate the low energy spectrum of fully connected graphs of size {\$}N{\$} approaching {\$}50{\$}.},

@article{Boixo2014,
abstract = {Quantum technology is maturing to the point where quantum devices, such as quantum communication systems, quantum random number generators and quantum simulators may be built with capabilities exceeding classical computers. A quantum annealer, in particular, solves optimization problems by evolving a known initial configuration at non-zero temperature towards the ground state of a Hamiltonian encoding a given problem. Here, we present results from tests on a 108 qubit D-Wave One device based on superconducting flux qubits. By studying correlations we find that the device performance is inconsistent with classical annealing or that it is governed by classical spin dynamics. In contrast, we find that the device correlates well with simulated quantum annealing. We find further evidence for quantum annealing in the form of small-gap avoided level crossings characterizing the hard problems. To assess the computational power of the device we compare it against optimized classical algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

@article{Baydin2018,
abstract = {Derivatives, mostly in the form of gradients and Hessians, are ubiquitous in machine learning. Automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation or simply "autodiff", is a family of techniques similar to but more general than backpropagation for efficiently and accurately evaluating derivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs. AD is a small but established field with applications in areas including computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very recently, the fields of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of each other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other's results. Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the machine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption under the names "dynamic computational graphs" and "differentiable programming". We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation techniques. By precisely defining the main differentiation techniques and their interrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms "autodiff", "automatic differentiation", and "symbolic differentiation" as these are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.},

We provide high-accuracy results for the residual entropy of the dimer model on the cubic lattice, water-ice $I_h$ and water-ice $I_c$. In addition, we show that these systems are in a Coulomb phase by computing the dipolar form of the correlation functions.

We propose a framework to map generic frustrated spin systems onto frustration-free models on a correlated phase space, resulting both in an improved analytical understanding of the ground state ensembles via local rules, and a natural construction of a tensor network on which standard algorithms can be used efficiently. The main technical ingredient consists in a linear program identifying large scale degrees of freedom for which the frustration can be relaxed. We illustrate the power of the method by determining the ground-state local rule and computing the residual entropy of a frustrated Ising spin system on the kagome lattice with next-next-nearest neighbour interactions.},
