einsum of outer product

i,j -> ij

# 2

The einsum notation "jk,kl,lm,mj ->" can be understood as two einsum as,

jk,kl,lm,mj -> jj

jj -> 

The first one is the production of four matrix ,with the first index of the first matrix equaling to the second index of the last matrix. The result of first einsum is therefore a square matrix.

The second einsum is the trace of the first matrix.

So "jk,kl,lm,mj ->" is the trace of the mutiplication of four matrix.

I will submit with a picture

Same as above. The different steps will be highlighted with different color.

The contraction cpmlexity can be estimated for two different steps,

1. for 7 red circles, there will be $7\times n^5$.

2. for 6 red circles, there will be $6\times n^6$. Since the contraction includes two dimensions, there will be one order higher comlexity.
