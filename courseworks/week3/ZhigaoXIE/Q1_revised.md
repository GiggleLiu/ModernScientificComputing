As the definition, the related condition number is: 
$$κ(a/b) = \lim_{\epsilon → 0} max{ \frac{|(a/b) * ((\epsilon a/a)-(\epsilon b / b))|} { |\epsilon(a/b)|} }$$

If 'a' is constant, let f(b) = a/b
$$κ(a/b) = max{ \frac{|(a/b) * (-(\epsilon b / b))|} { |-a(εb) / b²|} } = 1$$

So as when 'b' is constant. 

The relative condition number of the division operation is 1.
