Question 1:
Answer 1:	From the definition, we can know the related condition number is
	 $$κ(a/b) = \lim_{\epsilon → 0} max{ \frac{|(a/b) * ((\epsilon a/a)-(\epsilon b / b))|} { |\epsilon(a/b)|} }$$
If ‘a’ is a constant, define f(b) = a/b, then we have
	 $$κ(a/b) = max{ \frac{|(a/b) * (-(\epsilon b / b))|} { |-a(εb) / b²|} } = 1$$
So when ‘b’ is constant, the relative condition number of the division operation is 1.
Question 2:
Answer 2:
 ill=conditioned: (a), (d)				
 well-conditioned: (b), (c)
