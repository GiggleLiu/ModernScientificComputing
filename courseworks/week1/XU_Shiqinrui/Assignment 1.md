The estimation is:
$$
\begin{aligned}
FLPOS &= number\ of\ cores \times frequency\times4\times2\\
&=16\times3.7GHz\times4\times2\\
&=473.6GFLPOS
\end{aligned}
$$
### Q2
The signal can't travels faster than light. And the signal in a real circuit is actually much slower than the speed of light in vaccum. The fomula to calculate the actual speed is $v_s=\frac{c}{\sqrt{\epsilon_r\mu_r}}$. Since I didn't find a convincing result of speed of light in copper, I'll assume that the speed of light in copper is $2\times 10^8m/s$. And if CPU wants some data from memory, it needs to send the request to memory first. Then the memory will send the data to CPU. Thus the whole length the signal nees to travel is $10cm\times2=2\times10^{-1}m$. So the shortest time should be:
$$\begin{aligned}
t&=2\times10^{-1}m\div2\times 10^8m/s\\
&=1ns
\end{aligned}$$
But except the travel time, it also takes time that memory to look up the corresponeding data. And there are also some other factors that can slow down the process. Thus the actual  latency could be tens of $ns$ to hundred $ns$.

### Q3
Google has developed a variety of specialized hardware accelerators to support its artificial intelligence and machine learning efforts, including the Neural Network Processing Unit (NPU), Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), and Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). Each of these specialized processors has unique features that make them suitable for different applications and workloads.

Neural Network Processing Unit (NPU):
The Neural Network Processing Unit (NPU) is a hardware accelerator designed to speed up machine learning workloads. It is optimized for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other deep learning models. The NPU can perform thousands of operations per second, making it much faster than traditional CPUs for these types of workloads.

The NPU is designed to be integrated into system-on-chip (SoC) designs, allowing it to be used in a wide variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and other embedded devices. The NPU also has low power consumption, making it ideal for battery-powered devices.

Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA):
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are programmable hardware accelerators that can be reconfigured to perform different tasks. Unlike traditional CPUs, FPGAs are highly parallel, allowing them to perform many operations simultaneously. This makes them well-suited for tasks like image processing and video transcoding.

FPGAs are highly flexible and can be programmed to perform a wide variety of tasks. However, this flexibility comes at a cost: FPGAs are more difficult to program than traditional CPUs, and their performance can be highly dependent on the specific application.

Tensor Processing Unit (TPU):
The Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is a custom-built processor designed specifically for machine learning workloads. It is highly optimized for the TensorFlow framework, which is used extensively in Google's machine learning projects.

The TPU is highly parallel and can perform many operations simultaneously, making it much faster than traditional CPUs for machine learning workloads. It also has high memory bandwidth, allowing it to quickly access the large amounts of data needed for machine learning.

The TPU is designed to be used in large-scale data center environments and is available as a cloud service through Google Cloud Platform. This makes it easy for developers to use the TPU without needing to purchase and maintain their own hardware.

Conclusion:
Each of these specialized processors has unique features that make them suitable for different applications and workloads. The NPU is designed for low-power, embedded devices, while FPGAs are highly flexible and can be reconfigured to perform different tasks. The TPU is optimized for machine learning workloads and is available as a cloud service through Google Cloud Platform.

As machine learning and artificial intelligence continue to play a larger role in our lives, specialized hardware accelerators like these are becoming increasingly important. By providing faster, more efficient ways to perform machine learning workloads, these specialized processors are helping to drive the development of new and innovative AI applications.
### Q4
Floating point numbers violate the associativity, commutativity, and distributivity of addition and multiplication, as well as the existence of multiplicative inverses and the distributive law, to some extent, due to the limitations of finite precision arithmetic.

1.  Associativity of addition and multiplication: Due to rounding errors, the associativity of floating point addition and multiplication may not hold. This means that the result of a calculation may depend on the order in which operations are performed, which violates the associativity property.

2.  Commutativity of addition and multiplication: Due to rounding errors, the commutativity of floating point addition and multiplication may not hold. This means that the result of a calculation may depend on the order of operands, which violates the commutativity property.

3.  Distributivity of addition over multiplication and vice versa: Due to rounding errors, the distributive law of floating point arithmetic may not hold exactly. This means that the result of a calculation involving multiplication and addition may not be exactly equal to the result of applying the distributive law, which violates the distributivity property.

4.  Existence of multiplicative inverses: Floating point arithmetic only guarantees the existence of multiplicative inverses for non-zero values, and not for zero. This means that division by zero is undefined, which violates the existence of multiplicative inverses.

5.  Identity elements: Floating point arithmetic provides an additive identity element (0) and a multiplicative identity element (1), but these may not be exact values due to rounding errors. This means that the identities may not behave exactly as expected in some computations, and may not satisfy the field axioms exactly.

In summary, floating point arithmetic deviates from the ideal field properties in several ways due to the limitations of finite precision arithmetic, including the violations of the associativity, commutativity, and distributivity properties, as well as the existence of multiplicative inverses and the precision of identity elements.
