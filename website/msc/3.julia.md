## Installation Guide

### Step 1. Install/Update Julia binary
For Linux/Mac users, the easiest way to install Julia language is to open a terminal and type the following command to install [Julia](https://julialang.org/) with [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup)

```
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh
```

If you are suffering from the slow download speed.
An alternative approach is downloading the corresponding Julia binary from the [tuna mirror website](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/julia-releases/).
After installing the binary, please set the Julia binary path properly if you want to start the Julia REPL by typing `julia` a bash shell. 
To add Julia's bin folder (with full path) to `PATH` environment variable, you can edit the `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.bash_profile`) file. Open the file in your favourite editor and add a new line as follows:
```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/<Julia directory>/bin"
```
Please check this [official setup guide](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/) to learn more.

### Step 2. Configure the package source and `Revise` in the startup file
First create a new file `.julia/config/startup.jl` with the following content

```julia
ENV["JULIA_PKG_SERVER"] = "http://cn-southeast.pkg.juliacn.com"
try
    using Revise
catch e
    @warn "fail to load Revise."
end
```

The contents in the startup file is executed immediately after you open a new Julia session.

Then you need to install [Revise](https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl), which is an Julia package that can greatly improve the using experience of Julia. To install `Revise`, open Julia REPL and type
```julia
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add("Revise")
```
To exit Julia REPL, just press `CTRL`-`D`.

As a final step, please check your Julia configuration by openning a Julia REPL and type
```julia
julia> versioninfo()
Julia Version 1.8.2
Commit 36034abf260 (2022-09-29 15:21 UTC)
Platform Info:
  OS: Linux (x86_64-linux-gnu)
  CPU: 8 Ã— Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10510U CPU @ 1.80GHz
  WORD_SIZE: 64
  LIBM: libopenlibm
  LLVM: libLLVM-13.0.1 (ORCJIT, skylake)

Environment:
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gtk-3.0/modules:
  JULIA_PKG_SERVER = http://cn-southeast.pkg.juliacn.com
```
Please make sure your `JULIA_PKG_SERVER` is set properly.

#### Step 3. Download an editor: VSCode

Install VSCode by downloading the correct binary for your platform from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
Open VSCode and open the `Extensions` tab on the left side-bar of the window, search `Julia` and install the [Julia extension](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode).

You are ready to go, cheers!

## An introduction to the Julia REPL

A Julia REPL has four modes,

1. Julian mode is the default mode that can interpret your Julia code.

2. Shell mode is the mode that you can run shell commands. Press `;` in the Julian mode and type
```julia
shell> date
Sun Nov  6 10:50:21 PM CST 2022
```
To return to the Julian mode, type the `Backspace` key.

3. Package mode is the mode that you can manage packages. Press `]` in the Julian mode and type
```julia
(@v1.8) pkg> st
Status `~/.julia/environments/v1.8/Project.toml`
  [295af30f] Revise v3.4.0
```
To return to the Julian mode, type the `Backspace` key.

4. Help mode is the mode that you can access the docstrings of functions. Press `?` in the Julian mode and type
```julia
help> sum
... docstring for sum ...
```
To return to the Julian mode, type the `Backspace` key.

Learn more from [the official documentation about Julia REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/).

## Using Pluto notebooks
To open a pluto notebook, you should have `Pluto` package installed in your global environment by typing in the Pkg mode
```julia
pkg> add Pluto
```

Copy-pasting the following command to the end of your `~/.bashrc` file enables you to open a pluto notebook from a Linux shell.
```bash
alias pluto='julia -e "using Pluto
if length(ARGS) > 0
    notebook = ARGS[1]
    Pluto.run(notebook=joinpath(pwd(), notebook))
else
    Pluto.run()
end"'
```

To open a Pluto notebook in your browser, please open a new shell and type `pluto path/to/pluto/file`.
If the path is not provided, the command will open a the Pluto start up page in your browser.
