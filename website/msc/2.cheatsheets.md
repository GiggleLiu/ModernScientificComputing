# A Minimum Introduction to Linux, Vim and Git
In AMAT5315, we choose a [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) stack
* the [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/desktop) distribution of the [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) operating system as the programming platform,
* the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as the version control software and the [Github](https://github.com/) website as the place to store your code,
* the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language as the programming language to implement algorithms,
* the [VSCode](https://www.julia-vscode.org/) editor as the IDE to program Julia and
* the [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebooks as the tool for playing slides.

Except the Github website, all of the above mentioned software are open-source.

## Why open sourcing?
Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.
Ubuntu, Git (not the Github), Julia and Pluto are all open source software.
Open source software are incresingly popular for many reasons, having better control, easier to train programmers, **better data security**, stability and **collaborative community**.

### Case study 1: Doc and Docx, Linux and [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

[Reading: What Is a .DOCX File, and How Is It Different from a .DOC File in Microsoft Word?](https://www.howtogeek.com/304622/what-is-a-.docx-file-and-how-is-it-different-from-a-.doc-file-in-microsoft-word/)

> Under pressure from the rising competition of the free and open-source Open Office and its competing Open Document Format (ODF), Microsoft pushed for the adoption of an even broader open standard in the early 2000s. This culminated in the development of the DOCX file format, along with its companions like XLSX for spreadsheets and PPTX for presentations.

## What is a Linux operating system?
Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system.
It is free to use, [open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source), widely used on clusters and good at automating your works.
The Ubuntu system is one of the most popular [Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution).

## A cheatsheet for Bash scripting
Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project.
in Ubuntu, one can use `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T` to open a bash shell.
In a bash shell, we use `man command_name` to get help information related to a command,
use `CTRL-C` to break a program and `CTRL-D` to exit a shell or an REPL.

The bash grammar is well summarized in [this cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/bash).
The following is a short list for commands that will be used in this course.

```
man     # an interface to the system reference manuals

ls      # list directory contents
cd      # change directory
mkdir   # make directories
rm      # remove files or directories
pwd     # print name of current/working directory

echo    # display a line of text
cat     # concatenate files and print on the standard output

alias   # create an alias for a command

lscpu   # display information about the CPU architecture
lsmem   # list the ranges of available memory with their online status

top     # display Linux processes
ssh     # the OpenSSH remote login client
vim     # Vi IMproved, a programmer's text editor
git     # the stupid content tracker

useradd # create a new user or update default new user information
passwd  # change user password

tar     # an archiving utility
```

A more detailed [cheat sheet](https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/linux-command-line/) and a [lecture](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/shell-tools/) are available online.

### SSH
[SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Its most notable applications are remote login and command-line execution.
To learn more about SSH and two factor authentication, please check [this lecture](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/security/).

With a host name (the IP of the target machine to login) and a user name, one can use the following command to login,
```bash
ssh <username>@<hostname>
```
You will get logged in after inputting the password.

### Vim editor
A vim editor can be found in any Linux distribution, with or without a graphical user interface. To edit a file, just type `vim file_name`.

```
i       # input
:w      # write
:q      # quit
:q!     # force quit without saving

u       # undo
CTRL-R  # redo
```
All the commands must be executed in the command mode (the default mode when you start a vim editor),
If you are currently in the input mode, you can alway type `ESC` to go back to the command mode.

## A cheatsheet for Git and Github

Git is a tool for version control.
It is an important tool for programmers to keep track of the different versions of a program and collaborate with others.
GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code.
There are more than 100 git sub-commands, and the following is a short list to keep in mind.

```
# global config
git config  # Get and set repository or global options

# initialize a repo
git init    # Create an empty Git repo or reinitialize an existing one
git clone   # Clone repository into new directory

# info
git status  # Show the working tree status
git log     # Show commit logs
git diff    # Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc

# work on a branch
git add     # Add file contents to the index
git rm      # Remove files from the working tree and from the index
git commit  # Record changes to the repository
git reset   # Reset current HEAD to the specified state

# branch manipulation
git checkout # Switch branches or restore working tree files
git branch  # List, create, or delete branches
git merge   # Join two or more development histories together

# remote synchronization
git remote  # Manage set of tracked repositories
git pull  # Fetch from and integrate with another repo or a local branch
git fetch   # Download objects and refs from another repository
git push    # Update remote refs along with associated objects
```

A more detailed introduction could be found in this [lecture](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/).

### Examples
1. create a new git repo and make your first commit
Go to the folder that you want to create a git repo from and type
```
git init     # will create a `.git` folder under the current directory.
git add -A   # add all files to git
git commit -m 'some description about the change'
```
Here we have used `-A` to add/remove file automatically instead of adding the files one by one.
You might want to edit the `.gitignore` file to avoid adding garbage files to the commit history by accident.
The following is a typical .gitignore file for a Julia package
```
.DS_Store
.vscode
*.swp

*.jl.*.cov
*.jl.cov
*.jl.mem

Manifest.toml

/docs/build/
/docs/Manifest.toml
```
All files matching the above patterns will be ignored by `git add -A`.

2. upload your local repository to Github
Open your Github homepage, click new repository.
(check)
Please do not need to choose adding README or LICESE if you are creating a Julia package, because the `PkgTemplates` will generate one for you.
Then you will see a detailed instruction, just follow the instruction.

3. making a **pull request**
*pull request* means proposing a change to a repository that you may or may not have the edit permission.

To start making a pull request, you should find the Github repo, click the `fork` icon at the top right of the webpage. A copy of the Github repo will be created under your own account so that you can edit it freely.
```
git clone https://github.com/my-github-name/ModernScientificComputing
git checkout -b my-own-branch-name  # create a new branch
# make some edits ...
git push origin   # will upload the edits to your github repository
```
Go to the forked repository under your own account, you will see a button showing up to suggest you making a pull request, just following the guide.
If you did not see the button poping up, which happens if your edit is old than several hours, you can also go to the pull request page to create a pull request from there.
