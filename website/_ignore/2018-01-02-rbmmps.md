title: RBM-MPO ansatz

## Definition of RBM-MPO ansatz
$$\langle\sigma\vert\psi\rangle=\sum\limits_{\{b_i\},\{\sigma_i'\}}\prod\limits_i O^{\sigma_i,\sigma'_i}_{b_{i-1},b_{i}}f(W,\sigma_i')$$.

## Training

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial W}=\frac{\partial}{\partial\psi}\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial f}\frac{\partial f}{\partial W}$$ is in general not accessable because we have infinitely many $\{\sigma_i'\}$. However, we can sample over $\{\sigma_i'\}$ instead of $\{\sigma_i\}$  and train it with VMC (so called Heisenberg picture). This time, the exploding Hilbert space problem is transformed into how to optimize $O$.

Impose translational invariance on $Oâ€‹$, and resort to VUMPO approach to optimize it.
