title: Quantum Representation Power
---

Notice the following facts
* The representation power of a noisy quantum device is restricted.
* The representation power of a shallow quantum circuit is restricted.

I want to give a measure of representation power from measurement results.
Here, I'd like to introduce the concept of "volume of reduced density matrixs (RDM)".
* If the circuit is noisy enough, that fully coupled with environment, its RDM is $-$.

Questions:
* any one come up with similar idea?

### Why this is important
The reason I came up
